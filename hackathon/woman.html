                <p>
                    Sexuality education (CSE) gives young people accurate, age-appropriate information about sexuality
                    and their sexual and reproductive health, which is critical for their health and survival.<br><br>

                    While CSE programmes will be different everywhere, the United Nations’ technical guidance – which
                    was developed together by UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UN Women, UNAIDS and WHO – recommends that these
                    programmes should be based on an established curriculum; scientifically accurate; tailored for
                    different ages; and comprehensive, meaning they cover a range of topics on sexuality and sexual and
                    reproductive health, throughout childhood and adolescence.<br><br>

                    Topics covered by CSE, which can also be called life skills, family life education and a variety of
                    other names, include, but are not limited to, families and relationships; respect, consent and
                    bodily autonomy; anatomy, puberty and menstruation; contraception and pregnancy; and sexually
                    transmitted infections, including HIV.

                <h1 style="margin-top: 40px; color: blue; text-align: center;">Importance Of Sex Education:-</h1>
                <p>Sex education is essential in a country like India where the
                    adolescent population is rapidly growing, and the incidence of teenage pregnancies, sexually
                    transmitted
                    infections (STIs), and HIV/AIDS is on the rise. Inadequate sex education can lead to unintended
                    pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and increased rates of STIs and HIV/AIDS. Additionally, it can
                    perpetuate
                    gender stereotypes and lead to sexual violence and exploitation.<br><br>

                    Effective sex education can help prevent these outcomes by providing accurate and age-appropriate
                    information on sexual and reproductive health, including contraception, STIs, and consent. It can
                    also
                    help promote healthy relationships, gender equality, and respect for diversity.
